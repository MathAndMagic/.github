We are on a mission to find new ways for humanity to benefit from AI.

Our R&D focuses on the following areas:

- Autonomous AI Agents
- Natural Language Processing (primarily LLMs)
- Machine Translation

## Projects We Encourage You to Try

- [**Bridge**](https://brid93.com) ‚Äî an agent-native, all-in-one digital workspace for collaborating with AI on real-world tasks.
- [**Polaris**](https://github.com/MathAndMagic/polaris) ‚Äî a family of open source models designed for autonomous AI agent scenarios.

Stay tuned for more projects coming this year!

## Join Us üõ†Ô∏è

We're always looking for talented developers and rising AI researchers to join our great team.

  - LLM researchers + ML engineers - to work on Polaris
  - Rust developers - to work on Bridge
  - JS developers - to work on UI for Bridge and other applications / services

  If you're find any of these attractive, please write us at jobs@mathandmagic.ai.

  <details>
    <summary>A few things to know upfront:</summary>
    
  1. All positions are available as either 100% remote or based in our Cyprus office.
  2. The salary is pretty good!
  3. We will ask you to make a meaningful commit to any of our public repositories, as this gives us something to discuss during the interview. We believe this approach is much more beneficial for both parties than asking for tasks like writing a bubble sort or walking a tree.
